      RADC ENTERPRISES, INC. FOR LABOR CODE VIOLATIONS
    </h1>

  <section class="main-content">
    <h1>Announcement Regarding Lawsuit Against RADC Enterprises, Inc. for Labor Code Violations</h1>
    <p>We have filed a lawsuit against the gas station operator RADC Enterprises, Inc. (“RADC”).</p>
    <p>The lawsuit is in Contra Costa County Superior Court, Case No. C23-00683.</p>
    <p>If you work or worked for RADC, you may have a right to monetary recovery. The amount of the monetary recovery
      will likely depend on how strong a case we can make. This is not a lawsuit against you; you are not being sued.
    </p>

    <p><strong>This is not a lawsuit against you; you are <u>not</u> being sued.</strong></h3>
    
    <p>Former RADC employee, Kasim Tarin, initiated the potential class action and representative action lawsuit seeking
      to represent other current and former employees of RADC. The lawsuit alleges that RADC employees were required to 
      work off-the-clock, through rest breaks and meal periods, were not paid sick leave, and were not reimbursed for 
      work-related expenses, amongst other violations.</p>

    <h3>WE NEED YOUR SIGNED AUTHORIZATION</h3>
    <p>We are investigating the case and would like to request your time and payroll records from RADC. Your
      authorization will help us build our case to get the best result for everyone. <b>To get your records, we need
        your
        written authorization.</b> You can give authorization online following the link below.
