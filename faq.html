    <h3>
        Why do you need my time and payroll records?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Your authorization will help us build our case to get the best result for all potential class members.
        Basically,
        Mr. Mata believes that Centimark Corporation (also known as Questmark) owes their California non-exempt
        employees
        money for making them work through rest and meal period breaks, not paying them all wages due (including
        prevailing
        wages and wages for travel time), not paying them for all overtime they worked, and not paying them all earned
        and
        unused vacation pay at termination. Centimark/Questmark kept or should have kept records of many of these things
        including employee work hours.
    </p>

    <h3>Why do you need my personnel records?</h3>

    <p>
        The more people we have who sign authorizations, the more pressure that puts on the company to resolve the case
        quickly and favorably. That is because the authorizations show that a large number of current and former
        employees are interested in the case.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do not want to give us this authorization, that is fine. If the Court allows Mr. Mata to represent you,
        you will still be given the option to participate as a member of the class.
    </p>

    <h3>How do I give you my authorization?</h3>
    <p>
        Click <a href="index.html">here</a> to go back and fill out the form at the bottom.
    </p>

    <h3>Is this a class action?</h3>

    <p>
        Not yet. To proceed as a class action, Mr. Mata will be required to file papers with the Court requesting that
        the Court allow him to represent Centimark/Questmark employees who suffered the same California Labor Code
        violations that he did.
    </p>

    <h3>Do I have to pay anything? Even if Mr. Mata loses?</h3>

    <p>
        There is no charge to you for giving us the authorization to request your records. Even if you give us your
        authorization, you are not a plaintiff in the lawsuit. You are not a party. You will not owe anything if Mr.
        Mata loses.
    </p>
